# Model
Code for the paper [Ensemble Learning for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.14166.pdf). This paper proposes an ensembling method with Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) and achieving state-of-the-art performance on ogbl-ddi.

## Quick Start 
Here, we provide a quick start guide on how to reproduce the results.

### Download the project and install the required dependencies.
